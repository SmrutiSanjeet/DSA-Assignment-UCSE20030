# DSA-Assignment-UCSE20030
In the course of doing this assignment I got to learn new concepts and methods in python and c, it also helped me fuel my problem solving skills. 
I would like to thank Mrs. Monalisa Mandal maam for giving us the oppurtunity to work on this. It acted as a revision of our Data Structures and Algorithms course, it was my pleasure to work on such an informative assignment.
